Nesta has a fair number of bits and pieces that users can reasonably
expect to work together. For example, themes and plugins should all work
with the latest release of Nesta.

The scripts in this project are used to check out whether or not pages
render successfully with different themes, under different releases of
Nesta.

This project is thereofre only really of interest to people who want to
make sure that Nesta is working fine with all the bits and pieces that
go with it. That probably means that you're either a) a very
concientious theme author, or b) me (gma).
